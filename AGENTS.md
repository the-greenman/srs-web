# Agents — read `CLAUDE.md` first; it is canonical for this repo. This file carries only what a non-Claude agent needs beyond it.

- **Current work**: the-greenman/srs#512 is the queue. Read it before starting anything — it holds the ordered remaining units, not this file.
- **Signing**: run `ssh-add -l | grep -q "SHA256:vHuO6si5w3RLL4IJZofWbyvEi42WA2fYX7bM"` before ANY commit. STOP and report if missing — never `--no-gpg-sign`, never `--no-verify`. Use plain `git commit`.
- **Do not invoke or follow `.claude/commands/*`** — those are Claude-specific. `epic-worker`/`epic-coordinator` are retired (srs#451). The process is `CLAUDE.md` + #512.
- **PRs**: label `epic-256:owner-merge`, body references `Closes #N` / `Refs #N`. Never merge.
- **Gates**: `npm run build`, `npm test`, `npx playwright test` (e2e is where bindings regressions show). Pin via `ensure-bindings.mjs`. Auto-deploys on push to `main` (Cloudflare Workers Builds) — never `npm run deploy`.
